add a user
Adds a user. Adding avatarUrl, emailAddress, gender, birthDate and birthPlace are optional.
For avatarUrl you have to upload a file in png, jpg or jpeg.
Be aware that city and country are integer fields, so you cannot insert their names in those fields.
You have to insert the international codes for countries and cities and the same rule is applied for birthPlace.
Calling this API only affects on user table.
For gender, [true] is male and [false] is female.
