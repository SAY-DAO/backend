update a child
All the fields are optional. You can fill every field you want to change, and it will update the desired child.
Calling this API only affects child table by updating a row.
Be aware that city and country are integer fields, so you cannot insert their names in those fields.
You have to insert the international codes for countries and cities.
The same rule applied for nationality and birthPlace.
For voiceUrl and avatarUrl you have to upload a file; for avatar in png, jpg or jpeg and for voice in wav, m4a, wma, mp3, aac or ogg format.
Social workers can change their NGO by editing id_ngo field.
