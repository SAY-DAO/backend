update ngo
All the fields are optional.
You can fill every field you want to change, and it will update the desired NGO.
Calling this API only affects ngo table by updating a row.
Be aware that city and country are integer fields, so you cannot insert their names in those fields.
You have to insert the international codes for countries and cities.
For logoUrl you have to upload a file.
